# ✈️ Airline-Satisfaction-Insight

## ⚙️ Background
Our project's main objective is to predict future customer satisfaction by analyzing feedback from a specific airline, which we are referring to as Invistco Airlines for this project. We aim to determine the key factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and utilize this information to improve the experiences of neutral and dissatisfied customers.


## 📊 Data

This dataset comprises customer feedback from Invistco Airlines, including variables like passenger demographics (e.g., gender, age, and customer type) and satisfaction ratings for various service features such as seat comfort, inflight Wi-Fi, and more. It helps provide a solid foundation for in-depth analysis, exploring customer satisfaction trends, and identifying key factors influencing passenger experiences. By examining these elements, users can uncover critical insights that drive improvements in service quality and enhance decision-making for customer-centric initiatives.
